Description
---
Developed in 6 weeks, the group was given a rough game design document detailing the general mechanics of the game which (hopefully) can still be found [here](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gogo/courses/imgd4000_2014d/JaegerDescription.pdf). We then picked a style for the game and developed according to our own interpretation of the design given to us and our own decisions about how our version should work.

The game takes place in a haunted Gothic dungeon, where the adventurers work to gather gold and fend off the spirits that haunt the halls. There is then a boss that the player must defeat to escape the dungeon alive.

It can be played either in single player or co-op mode with another person.

Playing
---
You can either host a game or join one.

To host, click on "Create a server and play" (check the "Local game" check box and then click if you want to play alone). Then input dimensions for the maze, enter a number to specify how many walls should be destroyed and (optionally) enter a random seed for the maze. Then click "Start Game" and enjoy.

To join a game, click "Join a game" and pick one from the list of games shown and you will join the selected game. If there are no games you can click "Find Games" to see if any have started since you reached this screen. Otherwise, there are simply no hosted games.

While in game, you can press ESC to bring up a menu where you can either quit to the menu or quit the game (will only bring you back to the menu if you are playing in a web browser; Unity web player does not have any concept of quitting).
